issues:
found issue with user vs AI where the user would guess a number between 1 and 10 but if the user guessed 10, AI would say higher, or if user guessed 1 the AI would say lower.

found issue with AI vs user, where there was a double input of the user controls of H L or C, for example, if the user is thinking of 5 and AI guessed 4, I would input H for higher, but two H H would appear on seperate lines.
